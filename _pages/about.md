Hi! I'm a data scientist experienced in helping businesses grow through data-driven decision-making. I also have a BS in Cognitive Science (minor in Data Science) and an MS in Data Science from UC San Diego.

With strong foundations in statistics, machine learning, and data visualization, as well as high proficiency in Python, SQL, and other languages, I try to bring a wealth of technical skills and innovation to projects.

On this site you’ll find a selection of my **projects**, **publications**, and my **CV**, plus a few things I’m currently exploring in data science and ML.
